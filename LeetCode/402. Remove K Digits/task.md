Given string num representing a non-negative integer num, and an integer k, return _the smallest possible integer_ after removing k digits from num.

### Example 1:

_Input_: num = "1432219", k = 3
_Output_: "1219"
_Explanation_: Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 2 to form the new number 1219 which is the smallest.

### Example 2:

_Input_: num = "10200", k = 1
_Output_: "200"
_Explanation_: Remove the leading 1 and the number is 200. Note that the output must not contain leading zeroes.

### Example 3:

_Input_: num = "10", k = 2
